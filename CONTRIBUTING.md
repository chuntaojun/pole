# Contributing to Conf-Group/conf

Welcome to Conf-Group/conf! This document is a guideline about how to contribute to Conf-Group/conf.

If you find something incorrect or missing, please leave comments / suggestions.

## Before you get started

### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

#### Open / pickup an issue for preparation

If you find a typo in document, find a bug in code, or want new features, or want to give suggestions, you can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Conf-Group/conf/issues/new) to report it.

If you just want to contribute directly you can choose the issue below.

-   [Contribution Welcome](https://github.com/Conf-Group/conf/labels/contribution%20Welcome): Heavily needed issue, but currently short of hand.
    
-   [good first issue](https://github.com/Conf-Group/conf/labels/good%20first%20issue): Good for newcomers, new comer can pickup one for warm-up.
   

Please note that any PR must be associated with a valid issue. Otherwise the PR will be rejected.

#### Begin your contribute

Now if you want to contribute, please create a new pull request.

We use the `develop` branch as the development branch, which indicates that this is a unstable branch.

Further more, our branching model complies to [https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). We strongly suggest new comers walk through the above article before creating PR.

Now, if you are ready to create PR, here is the workflow for contributors:

1.  Fork to your own
    
2.  Clone fork to local repository
    
3.  Create a new branch and work on it
    
4.  Keep your branch in sync
    
5.  Commit your changes (make sure your commit message concise)
    
6.  Push your commits to your forked repository
    
7.  Create a pull request to **develop** branch.
    

When creating pull request:

1.  Please follow [the pull request template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
    
2.  Please create the request to **develop** branch.
    
3.  Please make sure the PR has a corresponding issue.
    
4.  If your PR contains large changes, e.g. component refactor or new components, please write detailed documents about its design and usage.
    
5.  Note that a single PR should not be too large. If heavy changes are required, it's better to separate the changes to a few individual PRs.
    
6.  After creating a PR, one or more reviewers will be assigned to the pull request.
    
7.  Before merging a PR, squash any fix review feedback, typo, merged, and rebased sorts of commits. The final commit message should be clear and concise.
    

If your PR contains large changes, e.g. component refactor or new components, please write detailed documents about its design and usage.

### Code review guidance

Committers will rotate reviewing the code to make sure all the PR will be reviewed timely and by at least one committer before merge. If we aren't doing our job (sometimes we drop things). And as always, we welcome volunteers for code review.

Some principles:

-   Readability - Important code should be well-documented. API should have Javadoc. Code style should be complied with the existing one.
    
-   Elegance: New functions, classes or components should be well designed.
    
-   Testability - 80% of the new code should be covered by unit test cases.
